	 * Provider for editable custom editors that use a custom document model.
	 *
	 * Custom editors use [`CustomDocument`](#CustomDocument) as their document model instead of a [`TextDocument`](#TextDocument).
	 * This gives extensions full control over actions such as edit, save, and backup.
	 *
	 * You should use this type of custom editor when dealing with binary files or more complex scenarios. For simple
	 * text based documents, use [`CustomTextEditorProvider`](#CustomTextEditorProvider) instead.
